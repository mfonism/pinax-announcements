`pinax-announcements` is a well tested, documented, and proven solution
for any site wanting announcements for it's users.

Announcements have title and content, with options for filtering their display:

* `site_wide` - True or False
* `members_only` - True or False
* `publish_start` - date/time or none
* `publish_end` - date/time or none

`pinax-announcements` has three options for dismissing an announcement:

* `DISMISSAL_NO` - always visible
* `DISMISSAL_SESSION` - dismiss for the session
* `DISMISSAL_PERMANENT` - dismiss forever
### Supported Django and Python Versions

* Django 1.8, 1.10, 1.11, and 2.0
* Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6

## Installation

To install pinax-announcements:

    pip install pinax-announcements

Add `pinax.announcements` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "pinax.announcements",
        ...
    )

Optionally, if you want someone other than staff to manage announcements,
enable this authentication backend:

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
        ...
        "pinax.announcements.auth_backends.AnnouncementPermissionsBackend",
        ...
    ]

then enable permission `"announcements.can_manage"` for these managers.

Lastly add `pinax.announcements.urls` to your project urlpatterns:

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r"^announcements/", include("pinax.announcements.urls", namespace="pinax_announcements")),
        ...
    ]

## Usage

### Templates

You have two options for `pinax-announcements` templates:

#### 1. Use pre-built Bootstrap-based templates

This is the simplest method. `pinax-announcements` templates are found in the Pinax `pinax-theme-bootstrap` [theme project](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap). These templates work with the Bootstrap front-end framework as well as the Font Awesome icon library. If you [include](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap#getting-started) `pinax-theme-bootstrap` in your project these templates and icons are found and used automatically.

#### 2. Create new templates

Just a bit more effort—copy `pinax-theme-bootstrap` [templates](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap/tree/master/pinax_theme_bootstrap/templates/pinax/announcements) into your project and modify as needed.

For instance, if your project doesn't use Bootstrap, remove Bootstrap and Font Awesome class names from your templates copies. Remove class references like `class="btn btn-success"` and `class="icon icon-pencil"` as well as removing `bootstrap` from the `{% load i18n bootstrap %}` statement. Since `bootstrap` template tags and filters are no longer loaded, you'll also need to update `{{ form|bootstrap }}` to `{{ form }}` since the "bootstrap" filter is no longer available.


### Displaying Announcements

First load the template tags:

    {% load pinax_announcements_tags %}

Then fetch announcements with the `announcements` template tag:

    <h3>Announcements</h3>

    {% announcements as announcement_list %}

    {% if announcements_list %}
        <div class="announcements">
            {% for announcement in announcement_list %}
                <div class="announcement">
                    <strong>{{ announcement.title }}</strong><br />
                    {{ announcement.content }}
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
    {% endif %}

If your announcement content is too large for viewing inline
then show a link to a detail view:

    <a href="{{ announcement.get_absolute_url }}">Read more...</a>

See [Template Tags](#template-tags) for detail on pinax-announcements template tags.

### Dismissing Announcements

Add this markup to show a "Dismiss" link if available:

    {% if announcement.dismiss_url %}
        <form class="form ajax" data-replace-closest=".announcement" action="{{ announcement.dismiss_url }}" method="post">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <button class="btn btn-default">Clear</button>
        </form>
    {% endif %}

#### Dismissal with Eldarion AJAX

The anchor markup shown above and the announcement dismissal view both conform
to an `AJAX` response that [eldarion-ajax](https://github.com/eldarion/eldarion-ajax) understands.
Furthermore, the templates that ship with this project will work
seemlessly with `eldarion-ajax`. Include the
eldarion-ajax.min.js Javascript package in your base template:

    {% load staticfiles %}
    <script src="{% static "js/eldarion-ajax.min.js" %}"></script>

and include `eldarion-ajax` in your site JavaScript:

    require('eldarion-ajax');

This of course is optional. You can roll your own JavaScript handling as
the view also returns data in addition to rendered HTML. Furthermore, if
you don't want `ajax` at all the view will handle a regular `POST` and
perform a redirect.

## Signals

### pinax.announcements.signals.announcement_created

This signal is sent immediately after an announcement is created.
It provides a single `kwarg` of `announcement`, the created `Announcement` instance.
Sender is the newly created Announcement instance.

### pinax.announcements.signals.announcement_updated

This signal is sent immediately after an announcement is updated.
It provides a single `kwarg` of `announcement`, the updated `Announcement` instance.
Sender is the newly updated Announcement instance.

### pinax.announcements.signals.announcement_deleted

This signal is sent immediately after an announcement is deleted.
It provides a single `kwarg` of `announcement`, the deleted `Announcement` instance.
Sender is `None`.

## Template Tags

### announcements

Filters announcements by `publish_start` and `publish_end` date range, including
all with no `publish_end` value.
Returns announcements matching `site_wide == True` and `members_only == False`,
and which are not dismissed.

    {% announcements as announcement_list %}
    {% for announcement in announcement_list %}
        <div>
            {{ announcement.title }}<br />
            {{ announcement.content }}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
